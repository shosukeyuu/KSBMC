  abstract = {This paper contributes to the recent and on-going work in the logical community [2, 14, 24, 8, 10, 9, 7] on dealing with mechanisms for belief revision and update within the Dynamic-Epistemic Logic (DEL) paradigm. DEL originates in the work of Gerbrandy and Groeneveld [30, 29], anticipated by Plaza in [44], and further developed by numerous authors [6, 31, 22, 4, 23, 39, 5, 15, 16] etc. In its standard incarnation, as presented e.g., in the recent textbook [25], the DEL approach is particularly well fit to deal with \mkbibemph{complex multi-agent learning actions} by which groups of interactive agents update},
